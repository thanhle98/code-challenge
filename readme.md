This repository contains solutions to the 99Tech code challenge by [Thanh Le](mailto:thanhlx1298@gmail.com). Each problem is organized in its own directory with specific setup instructions.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Problem 1 - Computational Logic
**Location**: `src/problem1/`  
**Type**: JavaScript solution  
**Description**: Computational efficiency and algorithm optimization

```bash
# Navigate to problem 1
cd src/problem1

# Run the solution
node answer.js
```

### Problem 2 - Currency Swap Form (React)
**Location**: `src/problem2/`  
**Type**: React TypeScript application  
**Description**: Interactive currency swap interface with real-time conversion

# Navigate to problem 2
cd src/problem2

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev

# Build for production
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

**Features:**
- Real-time currency conversion
- Search and filter currencies
- Balance validation
- Responsive design
- Error handling

### Problem 3 - Code Refactoring (React TypeScript)
**Location**: `src/problem3/`  
**Type**: React TypeScript refactoring exercise  
**Description**: Component optimization and code quality improvements

```bash
# Navigate to problem 3
cd src/problem3

# View the refactored component
cat main.tsx
```

**Refactoring Details:**
